        The <b>rich:popupPanel</b> component is used to create any kind of popups on the page.
    </p>

    <p>Main features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two states; modal and non-modal</li>
        <li>Can be defined as resizable</li>
        <li>Can be autosized according to content</li>
        <li>Can be moved across the screen</li>
        <li>Can be automatically positioned as centered or use a defined position</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This example shows a simple <b>non-modal popup</b> which is movable but not resizable and defined to use <b>autosizing</b>
        according to it's content
    </p>

    <ui:include src="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
    <ui:include src="/templates/includes/source-view.xhtml">
        <ui:param name="src" value="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
        <ui:param name="sourceType" value="xhtml" />
        <ui:param name="openLabel" value="View Source" />
        <ui:param name="hideLabel" value="Hide Source" />
    </ui:include>

    <p>This example also shows two variants of working with the component JavaScript API:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The popup is called by the <b>rich:componentControl</b> attached to button</li>
        <li>The popup is closed by a simple JavaScript call which is defined using the <b>rich:component</b> function</li>
    </ul>
</ui:composition>
