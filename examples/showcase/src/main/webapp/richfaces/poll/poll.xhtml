    <p>
        The <b>rich:poll</b> component defines a way to periodically poll a server in order to trigger state changes, or update
        parts of your page. You can use the same options, and settings as the rich:ajax or rich:commandButton. So you can set
        execute, and render attributes, as well as any normal JSF action attributes. RichFaces uses a standard form based
        request, so the form around the rich:poll component is required.
    </p>

    <p>The example below updates the date and time on the page based on the data on the server. To turn off polling, press
        "Stop Polling" button.</p>
