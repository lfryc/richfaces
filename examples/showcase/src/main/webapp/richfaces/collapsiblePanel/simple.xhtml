        The <b>rich:collapsiblePanel</b> component is fully analogous to a simple <b>rich:panel</b> component. Except that it
        can be collapsed, and expanded. In the collapsed state only the header is shown and in expanded state the complete
        panel.
    </p>

    <p>
        As with most of switchable components it has three <b>switch types</b> for switching between states - <b>ajax</b>, <b>server</b>
        and <b>client</b>. See the rich:togglePanel for details.

        defined via the <b>toggleListener</b> attribute
