    <p>This example shows how to use external controls, and special shortcuts to switch the tabbed panels</p>

    <p>
        The <b>rich:toggleControl</b> behavior used by any of the other switchable panels (<i>togglePanel, accordion</i>) can be
        used with <b>rich:tabPanels</b> as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        So you can set the <b>targetItem</b> to be defined as a specific tab name or use one of the shortcuts detailed in the <b>rich:togglePanel</b>
        example.
    </p>
    <ui:include src="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
    <ui:include src="/templates/includes/source-view.xhtml">
        <ui:param name="src" value="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
        <ui:param name="sourceType" value="xhtml" />
        <ui:param name="openLabel" value="View Source" />
        <ui:param name="hideLabel" value="Hide Source" />
    </ui:include>
    <p>
        Additionally you can manage the current tab on the server side using the <b>activeItem</b> attribute on the tabPanel <b>bound
            to some Bean property</b> which then holds current tab name.
    </p>
