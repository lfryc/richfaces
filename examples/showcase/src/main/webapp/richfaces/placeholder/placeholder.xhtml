    <p>
        Placeholder component brings functionality similar to HTML5 placeholder
        together with a backward compatibility for non-compliant browsers
        and together with additional features:
        
        <ul>
            <li>per-component styling (<tt>styleClass</tt> attribute)</li>
            <li>application to multiple components (<tt>selector</tt> attribute)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Placeholder component works with any JSF component which renders input or textarea
        as well as with non-JSF text inputs (using <tt>selector</tt> attribute).
    </p>

    <p>
        Bellow you can see sample of <tt>&lt;rich:placeholder /&gt;</tt> attached to standard inputs.
