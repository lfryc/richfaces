        The <b>rich:tooltip</b> component creates a small non-modal pop-up that can be used to display additional information
        for nearly anything on the page.
    </p>

    <p>Major features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tool-tip content may be <b>pre-rendered</b> on a page using client mode or <b>loaded dynamically</b> using
            separate Ajax requests via Ajax mode.</li>
        <li>In Ajax mode <b>default content</b> can be shown while the request is being executed</li>
        <li>Tool-tip's <b>look-n-feel is fully customizable</b> using both Richfaces skins and CSS style classes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are various other options available such as delays, follow modes, and more that are in the example below:</p>

    <ui:include src="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
    <ui:include src="/templates/includes/source-view.xhtml">
        <ui:param name="src" value="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
        <ui:param name="sourceType" value="xhtml" />
        <ui:param name="openLabel" value="View Source" />
        <ui:param name="hideLabel" value="Hide Source" />
    </ui:include>
</ui:composition>
