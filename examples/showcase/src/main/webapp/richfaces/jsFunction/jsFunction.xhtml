    <p>
        The <b>rich:jsFunction</b> component creates a JavaScript function that allows you to send JSF Ajax requests from any
        JavaScript. You define the Ajax and JSF properties just like rich:ajax, or rich:commandButton, and <b>rich:jsFunction</b>
        creates the JavaScript for you. The component sends a request using the standard JSF mechanisms. Note that this means a
        JSF form is required.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following example shows how to use <b>rich:jsFunction</b> to create a function named updateName. This is then called
        on mouseover of the different names. This triggers the full round trip Ajax request and renders the updated name.
