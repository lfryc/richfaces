        The <b>rich:select</b> component is designed to replace standard h:selectOneMenu. It adds various features and options
        including core Ajax functionality, and skinning. Some of the notable features are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Skinning following RichFaces standard principles. This allows the component to have unified look and feel
            across all the browsers.</li>
        <li>Better navigation across select items using the keyboard</li>
        <li>Default label functionality which is common for all the RichFaces inputs.</li>
    </ul>
